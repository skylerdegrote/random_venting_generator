# random_venting_generator
This was a peer project. Our objective was to make it look horrible and keep it funny. 


The goal of these peer project was to make an app that could randomly select sets of words and change them at a click of a button.
The project had the description of "really gross javascript" so my partner and I made it look horrible...on purpose.
We also added the ability to change the words independantly of each other.
